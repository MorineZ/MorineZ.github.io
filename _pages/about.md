# üòä About Me

- I am a fourth-year Ph.D candidate at School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](http://bme.ustc.edu.cn/)), supervised by Prof. [S. Kevin Zhou](https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/en/en_research_show/42.html).
- I received my bachelor degree and master degree from Shandong University ([SDU](https://www.sdu.edu.cn)) and Tianjin University ([TJU](https://www.tju.edu.cn)) in 2018 and 2021, respectively.
- My research interests mainly focus on **Medical tubular structure segmentation**.
